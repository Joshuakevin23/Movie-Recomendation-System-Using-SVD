Overview
This repository provides an implementation of a movie recommendation system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD is a matrix factorization technique used in collaborative filtering for generating personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and historical ratings.

Features
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes SVD for matrix factorization to recommend movies based on user ratings.
Customizable Parameters: Allows adjustment of factors, learning rate, and regularization terms.
Preprocessing: Includes data preprocessing steps to handle missing values and normalize ratings.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
